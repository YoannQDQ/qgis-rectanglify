Rectanglify
===
![Icon](./icon.png)

This plugin adds a digitizing tool in the QGIS advanced digitizing toolbar and the QGIS Edit menu.

The tool is only enabled for in-edition polygon layers. Behavior depends whether any features are selected or not:

- No selected features selected: rectanglifies all features
- Some selected features: rectanglifies selected features

Rectanglify replaces each feature's geometry by its minimum oriented bounding box.



Note that it relies on a custom implementation of the obb, since the QGIS method [orientedMinimumBoundingBox](https://qgis.org/api/classQgsGeometry.html#a9572d5cf0714fa5fc377b36ed71335d8) was flawed until recently (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34334)
